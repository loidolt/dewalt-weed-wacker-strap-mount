## General Info
This shoulder strap is designed to accomodate a DeWalt cordless wheed whacker, but would likely work with any standard size weed wheed whacker or edge trimmer. The two halves of the clamp attach with M5 hardware (be careful not to overtighten and strip the plastic threads). The eyelet is a 1/4-20 stainless steel hangar bolt. I recommend loosely attaching the mount, putting on the strap and adjusting it to comfort before fully tightening.
